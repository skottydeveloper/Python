# Python
## Summary
This repository is a portfolio of code for the Python programming language. It consists of projects I have completed, during uni and in my own time, while learning Python.

## Mini-Projects & Exercises
Consists of basic, miniature projects and exercises that demonstrate my knowledge in each feature of the Python programming language. For example, one project will demonstrate the application of knowledge in arrays, while another will demonstrate the application of knowledge in switch statements.
